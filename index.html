			<p class="personal-description" style="display: none;">
				I'm a person who's always driven by new ideas and new challenges, especially in the areas of communities and collaboration. I am fascinated with technology and its advancements, especially in the online and mobile arenas, striving each day to keep up with new development and innovation.				
			</p>
			
			<p class="personal-description" style="display: none;">
				I'm also a huge fan of the opensource and hacker culture, which were my main drivers in founding linuxNUS and HackerspaceSG. It is my personal belief that increased adoption of the hackers' exploratory culture will be immensely beneficial to the rate of innovation and creativity here in Singapore. As such, even though I've graduated from NUS, I still play an active role in the linuxNUS Coreteam in trying to cultivate more hackers in my alma mater. 
			</p>
			
			<p class="personal-description">
				I'm a hacker at heart, and nothing gets me more excited than a new project in which technology can be applied to make life easier, or more fun, for those involved. It's not just the technology itself that keeps me pumped, but it's using technology in a way that will bring value to someone else's life. Knowing that you've made someone happy through your skills - there's no greater reward.
